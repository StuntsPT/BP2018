## Statistical Concepts Revisited

---

## Variables

* Continuous

## Discreet variables

* Nominal
    * A
* Ordinal (ranked)
    * A
* Circular
    * A
* Ratios
    * A

---

## Dependent & independent variables

* Which is which

## Accuracy & Precision

![ac & pre pic](link)

* Systematic error
* Random error

---

## Populations & Samples

ID several concepts
* Population
* Sample
* Parameter
* Sample size
* Sampling

---

## Descriptive statistics

* Central tendency
* Dispersal

---

## Central tendency

* Mean - Average of all values
  * Arithmetic
  * Geometric
  * Harmonic
  * Weighted or unweighted
* Median - Central occurrence
* Mode - Most frequent occurrence

## Central tendency

---

## Dispersal

* Range - Diff. between Max. and Min.
* Variance - [Expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)
* Standard deviation - [Square root of variance](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)
* Coefficient of variation - Ratio of Std. Dev. to the mean
* Standard error - Std. Dev. of the sampling distribution
* Confidence interval

## Reporting descriptive statistics

* Use a central tendency measurement coupled with a dispersal measurement
  * Mean + Std. Dev.
  * Median + range
* Obtain precision estimates using SE or confidence interval
* Always remember:
  * Which measurements you have used
  * Present the value of "N"
  * Indicate the units!!!!111!one!

---

## Other descriptors

* q-Quantiles -  values that partition a finite set of values into *q* subsets of (nearly) equal sizes
* Quartile - A type of quantile. Divides the data in 4 equal parts. (Q2 is the median)
* Percentiles - Values that divide the sample into 100 equal parts

---

## Skewness & Kurtosis

---

## Distribution examples

* Normal
* Exponential
* Poisson
* Lognormal
* Beta
* Gamma
* "Paranormal distribution - disguised as a pumpkin

---

## Data transformations

* Logaritmic
* Square root
* Exponetial
* Arcsen
