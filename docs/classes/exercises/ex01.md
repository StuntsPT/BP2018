# Class 01 exercises

In this class we will learn how to transcribe data from a scientific research paper into a format we can work with. Since this is the first class, we will do it the hard way - manually. Don't worry, this is only an example, it's small, and you won't have to do it often (hopefully!).

Consider the following research paper: [RESPONSES OF DIATOM COMMUNITIES TO HEAVY METALS IN STREAMS: THE INFLUENCE OF LONGITUDINAL VARIATION][1]. It is a paper about how diatom communities respond to heavy metal concentration in their environment.


## 1. Data gathering

1. Find the data tables in the paper, and carefully read *Table 2*, "Physicochemical characteristics and diatom community variables from the six metal-polluted streams in August 1992".
2. Open a spreadsheet software of your choice (*MS Excel*, *Libreoffice Calc*, *Google spreadsheets*, etc.) and recreate the table from (**1.**) there.

*Hint* - Pay special attention to the following:

* Columns should be named
* Lines should be named
* The river name should be a variable too
* Do not use `whitespace`, `accentures` etc... in these names
* "Encode" any eventual missing data as `NA`


## 2. Basic data analyses

1. Describe the data you have:
 * Sample size
 * Number and type of variables
2. Calculate for each variable (total and per stream):
 * Minimum value
 * Maximum value
 * Average value
 * Standard deviation value
3. Plot the values of each variable


## Future proofing

1. Export your data in the `.csv` or `.tsv` format.
